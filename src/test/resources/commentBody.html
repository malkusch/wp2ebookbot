<div class="md"><p>There he sat, twirling his personal, stylized mustache. It was avant garde, just like he wanted to be. The man, as he was so, just wanted a place in this world for his art. He continues to stare at the easel, thinking. </p>\n\n<p>After a while he felt a firm, calming hand on his shoulder. He sighed, hanging his head wearily. &quot;Are you yet another man come to end my life, if you can even see it that way?&quot; The hand didn&#39;t answer, as it had no mouth. However, it&#39;s owner did, speaking the soft, assuaging tones that had come to make him famous. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;No sir. I&#39;ve seen too much death and war to want to do another such thing. Instead, I have come as a tutor. Here, grab that 2 inch brush and dip it in some titanium white and prussian blue.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Hitler did such a thing, and the man behind him nodded. &quot;Good. Now, mix them together, until you have a rather nice pale blue...&quot; </p>\n\n<p>Adolf did so, his brush strokes trembling across the pallette. &quot;Easy there tiger, try to keep yourself calm, now. Painting is all about being steady, confident.&quot; Adolf nodded again, and went this time, albeit a bit slower, and mixed another selection. After he had done this the stranger patted his shoulder. \n&quot;Good, now let&#39;s see you paint a nice, open sky.&quot;\n&quot;But how? I can barely paint the ground, let allow what lies above it!&quot; \nSighing, the man grabbed a firm hold of his arm and lifted it up. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;All you have to do is nice, tiny Xs, like so..&quot; \nA portion, the top left hand corner was soon filled with a nice layer of blue. \n&quot;Now go ahead, try it.&quot; \nAdolf sighed and attempted this, and, to his surprise, mimicked the man&#39;s stroke almost perfectly.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ah! There ya go! Now, wash that brush off in your water and beat the devil out of it on your wood there...&quot; </p>\n\n<p>At this point, adolf couldn&#39;t help but turn around in surprise. &quot;You want me to beat my easel with it..?&quot; </p>\n\n<p>The afro&#39;d figure behind him nodded, pulling off his woolen hood. &quot;Yes sir I Do. Go on. It won&#39;t hurt it.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Tell me who you are first, then maybe I will...&quot; \nThe figure smiled a bright smile, as a squirrel popped out of his hair.\n&quot;Why, I&#39;m Bob. Bob Ross. And I heard you wanted to be a painter.&quot;</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Just popping in to say thank you the beautiful person who have me a gold.</p>\n</div>
